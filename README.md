- 👋 Hi, I’m @MichaelNwaeze
- 👀 I’m interested in Coding, and learning from people who are more experienced in the field, especially in java.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on working with like minded people who want to also improve in not only their java journey but all coding in general.
- 📫 How to reach: my Email is nwaezemichael05@gmail.com. 
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: The main reason why i started to learn how to code was from a movie called Fast and Furious. I also really like playing soccer and basketball. I am a very fun person to be with. I like to sketch and draw on my free time.
